He took over the captaincy during a difficult period for Indian cricket (after the match-fixing scandal) and instilled a fighting spirit and a winning mentality. He is credited with identifying and nurturing young talents like Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, and Virender Sehwag, who went on to become legends of the game.\n",

      "*   **Notable Achievements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   Led India to the final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup.\n",
      "    *   Won the 2002 NatWest Series in England, a memorable victory for Indian cricket.\n",
      "    *   Holds the record for the most Player of the Series awards in ODIs for India (7).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Post-Retirement:** After retiring from international cricket, he served as the President of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and later as the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). As BCCI president, he oversaw significant developments in Indian cricket, including the introduction of day-night Test matches and improvements in infrastructure.\n",

       "Sourav Ganguly, affectionately known as \"Dada\" (meaning \"elder brother\" in Bengali), is a former Indian cricketer, captain, and administrator who is widely regarded as one of the greatest captains in the history of the sport. He's a left-handed batsman known for his elegant strokeplay, particularly through the off-side, and a useful right-arm medium-pace bowler.\n",

       "\n",
       "*   **Captaincy:** He is most celebrated for his captaincy, transforming the Indian team into a formidable force. He took over the captaincy during a difficult period for Indian cricket (after the match-fixing scandal) and instilled a fighting spirit and a winning mentality. He is credited with identifying and nurturing young talents like Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, and Virender Sehwag, who went on to become legends of the game.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Batting Record:** A prolific batsman, he has impressive stats in both Tests and ODIs.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   **Tests:** 113 matches, 7212 runs, average of 42.17, 16 centuries\n",
       "    *   **ODIs:** 311 matches, 11363 runs, average of 41.02, 22 centuries\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Notable Achievements:**\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   Led India to the final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup.\n",
       "    *   Won the 2002 NatWest Series in England, a memorable victory for Indian cricket.\n",
       "    *   Holds the record for the most Player of the Series awards in ODIs for India (7).\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Post-Retirement:** After retiring from international cricket, he served as the President of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and later as the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). As BCCI president, he oversaw significant developments in Indian cricket, including the introduction of day-night Test matches and improvements in infrastructure.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, Sourav Ganguly is a highly influential figure in Indian cricket, remembered for his leadership, batting prowess, and contribution to shaping the modern Indian cricket team.\n"
